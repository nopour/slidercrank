The slider-crank mechanism is used in several engineering applications, such as automobile engines and pumps, with three revolute joints and one prismatic joint. While this mechanism has several bodies and several joints, it has only one degree of freedom. This CODES are organized to represent the analysis of the mentioned mechanism, wherein the flexible behavior of its components is considered. The Equation of Motion is extended, and results are obtained with Greenwood, Augmented, Elimination, and Integrated Multiplier methods.

abstract="The slider-crank mechanism, a fundamental component in various engineering applications, including automobile engines and pumps, features three revolute joints and one prismatic joint while possessing only one degree of freedom. This chapter comprehensively analyzes this mechanism, considering its components' rigid and flexible behaviors and introducing a newly developed B{\'e}zier-based integration approach to solve the governing equation. In this chapter, by extending the Equation of Motion (EOM), innovative methods such as Greenwood, Augmented, Elimination, and Integrated Multiplier are introduced and implemented to convert Differential Algebraic Equations (DAEs) to Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Additionally, implementing B{\'e}zier-based integration is proposed as an alternative to conventional approaches like Runge--Kutta methods and Euler due to its potential for significantly reducing execution time without compromising accuracy. Therefore, the primary objective of this chapter is to investigate how adopting B{\'e}zier-based integration can revolutionize real-time dynamics simulations of the slider-crank mechanism. It is demonstrated that incorporating B{\'e}zier-based integration leads to enhanced computational efficiency without sacrificing precision or reliability during real-time dynamics simulations. This research contributes significant insights into advancing simulation methodologies for complex mechanisms like the slider-crank system. For instance, using the B{\'e}zier technique can reduce the elapsed time to 45{\%}.",
