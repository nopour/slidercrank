# slidercrank
The slider-crank mechanism is used in several engineering applications, such as automobile engines and pumps, with three revolute joints and one prismatic joint. While this mechanism has several bodies and several joints, it has only one degree of freedom. This CODES are organized to represent the analysis of the mentioned mechanism, wherein the flexible behavior of its components is considered. The Equation of Motion is extended, and results are obtained with Greenwood, Augmented, Elimination, and Integrated Multiplier methods.
